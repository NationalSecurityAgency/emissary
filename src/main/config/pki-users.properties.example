# PKI Users Configuration File
# This file maps client certificate Distinguished Names (DNs) to Emissary roles.
#
# Format: certificate_dn = role1,role2,role3
#
# The certificate DN must match exactly what's in the client certificate's Subject field.
# You can use the following command to extract the DN from a certificate:
#   openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -noout -subject
#
# Example mappings:
# CN=John Doe,OU=Engineering,O=Emissary,C=US = emissary,admin
# CN=Jane Smith,OU=Operations,O=Emissary,C=US = emissary,support
# CN=Bob Manager,OU=Management,O=Emissary,C=US = emissary,manager,admin
# CN=Support User,OU=Support,O=Emissary,C=US = support
