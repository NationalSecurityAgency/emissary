     * Returns a string that contains one graphical unit (in this case an emoji) that consists of 5 Unicode scalar values.

     * cursor across this one emoji on the screen. The length of the UTF-8 encoded byte array is 17 bytes. One emoji, 17
     * UTF8 bytes.
     * <p>
     * SCALAR 1: First, there’s a base character that means a person face palming.
     * <p>
     * SCALAR 2: By default, the person would have a cartoonish yellow color. The next character is an emoji skintone
     * modifier the changes the color of the person’s skin (and, in practice, also the color of the person’s hair).
     * <p>
     * SCALAR 3 and 4: By default, the gender of the person is undefined, and e.g. Apple defaults to what they consider a
     * male appearance and e.g. Google defaults to what they consider a female appearance. The next two scalar values pick a
     * male-typical appearance specifically regardless of font and vendor. Instead of being an emoji-specific modifier like
     * the skin tone, the gender specification uses an emoji-predating gender symbol (MALE SIGN) explicitly ligated using
     * the ZERO WIDTH JOINER with the (skin-toned) face-palming person. (Whether it is a good or a bad idea that the skin
     * tone and gender specifications use different mechanisms is out of the scope of this post.)
     * <p>
     * SCALAR 5: Finally, VARIATION SELECTOR-16 makes it explicit that we want a multicolor emoji rendering instead of a
     * monochrome dingbat rendering.
